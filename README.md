# MyReads Project

* This is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books into shelves : 'read', 'currently reading' and 'want to read'.
* Each book has a control that lets you select a shelf for that book.
* The main page has a link to ```/search``` page that allows you to find books and add them to any shelf.

## Steps to run application:

* Download the code here: [My Reads](https://github.com/jyothisridhar/MyReads.git)
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
